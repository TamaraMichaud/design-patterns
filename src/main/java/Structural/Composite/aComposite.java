package Structural.Composite;

// treat individual or scalar components, as well as aggregate objects or collections of components uniformly
// so both of these can be treated in the same way

// why? we know that objects can use other objects fields or methods; either via inheritance, or composition.
// composition is what lets us make compound objects.
// e.g. shapes, resize() affects all shapes the same (?)


// summary: composite design pattern lets us treat objects and collections in the same way
// java supports container iteration with the Iterable<T> interface
// this way a single object is able to masquerade as a collection by returning a single-element collection
// containing only this
