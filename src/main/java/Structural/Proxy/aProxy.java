package Structural.Proxy;

// an interface for accessing a particular resource
// e.g. foo.bar()
// if you decided to move all your foo-related operations elsewhere
// would you need to change your code?
// not if you use a proxy!
// comes in many types; connection proxy, logging, virtual, guarding

// definition: a class that functions as an interface to a particular resource.
//      that resource may be remote, expensive to construct, or may require logging
//      or some other added functionality

// proxy vs decorator
// proxy tries to provide an identical interface,
// while decorator tries to enhance that interface.

// decorator typically aggregates / references the object it's decorating
// proxy does not
