3 main categories

Creational Pattern
- explicit - constructor
- implicit - dependency injection framework (dif), reflection
- wholesale - a single statement can satisfy the creation of the object
- piecewise - step-by-step - i.e. connector classes often require initialisation of managers etc (?)

Structural Pattern
- concerned with the structure, class members - class adhering to interfaces
- wrapper around the class which mimics underlying class
- stress the importance of good api design

Behavioural Pattern
- no central theme, all tackle different situations in different ways
