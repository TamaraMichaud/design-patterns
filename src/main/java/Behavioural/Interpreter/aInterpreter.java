package Behavioural.Interpreter;

// Interpreter pattern is a reflection of an entire field of computer science called compiler theory
// the general idea is that you have some text which needs to be processed
//
// textual input needs to be turned into object-oriented structures
// e.g. programming languages; compilers, interpreters, IDEs
//      html, xml, json etc
//      numeric expressions (3 + 4/5)
//      regular expressions
//  all things that you would need to build an interpreter for

// a component which processes structured text data.
// 2 stages:
// split it into lexical tokens - aka lexing
// interpret this sequence of tokens - aka parsing
